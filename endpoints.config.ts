 * deprecated and anything in `EXCLUDE`), writes them to `lexicons.json`, and
 * `@atproto/lex` fetches them plus any transitively-referenced schema defs. The
 * defs are needed for `$ref`s but are never listed as endpoints.
 *
 * - `INCLUDE_PREFIXES` — the curated namespaces. This is the one place to widen or
 *   narrow scope. Editing it changes what `seed-allowlist` pulls in and what the
 *   converter is willing to emit a path for.
 * - `NAMESPACE_ORDER` biases grouping/order in the rendered reference.

/**
 * Live-implementation boundary (`scripts/probe-implemented.ts` → `npm run probe`).
 *
 * The schema authorities publish every *specced* `com.atproto` endpoint, but
 * Bluesky's live services don't necessarily serve all of them yet — e.g. the newer
 * `com.atproto.identity` GET methods (`resolveDid`, `resolveIdentity`,
 * `refreshIdentity`) currently return `501 MethodNotImplemented`. The probe calls
 * each enumerated `com.atproto` **query** against the canonical Bluesky hosts and
 * records the ones that aren't served anywhere into `UNIMPLEMENTED_MANIFEST`;
 * `build-openapi` then unlists those (no path, no sidebar tag), exactly like
 * deprecated/unspecced endpoints. Only queries are probed — we never fire
 * procedures (writes) at the live network.
 *
 * Routing is the whole trick. Each method has a *home* service, and every host
 * returns `501 MethodNotImplemented` for methods that aren't its own, so a single
 * host can't tell "unimplemented" from "lives elsewhere". We probe a panel:
 *   - `appview` / `relay` are POSITIVE-only signals: a non-501 there means "served
 *     here, keep it" (this is what rescues `identity.resolveHandle`, `repo.getRecord`,
 *     `sync.*`); their 501 means nothing.
 *   - `pds` is the AUTHORITATIVE signal, but only once authenticated. The entryway
 *     auth-gates *before* method resolution, so unauthenticated every method — real
 *     or not — returns `401`. Set `BSKY_PROBE_IDENTIFIER` + `BSKY_PROBE_APP_PASSWORD`
 *     (any account's app password works — the probe only sends GETs, so it never
 *     writes despite the password's full scope) to get
 *     a real `501`-vs-`200/400` answer. Override the host with `BSKY_PROBE_PDS` if
 *     self-hosted. Without credentials the probe is a safe no-op: it can't reach the
 *     true handler, so it unlists nothing and warns.
 *
 * The decision per endpoint: keep if any host says implemented; unlist only if the
 * authoritative PDS says `501 MethodNotImplemented`; otherwise keep (inconclusive).
